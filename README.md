# Speech-to-text-using-Python
Real-time Speech-to-Text system for accurate, low-latency transcription with optional streaming and offline Whisper support.

Speech to Text
A real-time Speech‑to‑Text (STT) pipeline for converting audio into text with support for streaming microphone input, audio/video files, and offline/online backends. Designed for fast setup, reproducible experiments, and easy deployment.

Features
Real-time transcription from mic or files with low latency and configurable VAD.

Pluggable backends: offline Whisper and cloud providers (optional).

Batch or streaming modes with punctuation, timestamps, and diarization options.

Project Structure
src/: inference, streaming, and utilities.

models/: local checkpoints (if using offline models).

notebooks/: demos and evaluation.

data/: sample audio and test clips.

Setup
Clone repo and install requirements.

Optional: enable GPU for faster inference and large models.

Usage
Microphone (streaming):

python src/transcribe_stream.py --model base --lang en

File transcription:

python src/transcribe.py --source path/to/audio.wav --model base

Optional flags:

--device 0 --vad true --timestamps true --diarization false

Results
Word error rate (WER): <fill after evaluation>.

Average RTF/latency on CPU/GPU: <add numbers>.

Roadmap
Better diarization, multilingual models, endpointing, and on‑device quantization.
